Assignment name  : html_validator
Expected files   : *.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a strings as argument and checks the html tags. 
You don't need to know html to do this assignment.
Your program must return a 0 for valid input and prints on the standard output "OK" followed by a newline
if the expression is correctly bracketed, otherwise it returns 1 and prints "KO" followed by
a newline.

HTML opening tags look like this:
<something> and closing tags like this </something>

An opening tag must always be closed by the good closing tag in the
correct order. 

If there is no arguments, the program must print only a newline.

Examples :

$> ./html_validator '<b><blue></blue></b>'
OK

$> ./html_validator '<b><blue></b></blue>'
KO$

2 extra challanges:
- Tags can contain attributes, like this:
<blue attribute="bladiebla"> and closing </blue>
- IMG tags can exist on their own and don't need to be closed:
<img blue bla>
