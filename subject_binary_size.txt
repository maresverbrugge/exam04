Implement a function that culculates the size of a binary tree,
that is to say, the total number of nodes it contains.

The function should be declared as follows:
int size_binary_tree(t_btree *root);

You have to use the ft_btree.h file, which will ONLY contain:

typedef struct  s_btree
{
    int     value;
    struct s_btree  *left;
    struct s_btree  *right;
}               t_btree;

if the root node is NULL, return 0.
